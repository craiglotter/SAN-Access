SAN Access

Commerce I.T. commissioned a Storage Area Network (SAN) for use by the members of the Commerce Faculty, both Staff and Students. It was decided to manage access to the SAN system via a combination of the HTTP and FTP protocols and as such SAN Access provides the final user interface to the system. 

While much of the behind the scenes work takes place on OBE1, Commerce I.T.’s web and FTP server, SAN Access ties the access to these various elements together in a cohesive, logical application that makes enables users to effectively manage their file space.

Because SAN Access makes use of online protocols, access to the Commerce I.T. SAN is not restricted to the UCT network. Access from off-campus is therefore possible and makes this one of the strengths of implementing the SAN in this manner.
